# Morphological Operations

They are those that change the image by importing the shape of the image itself and the kernel.

### Erosion

The basic idea of erosion is how soil erosion only, erodes the boundaries of the foreground object (always try to keep the foreground blank).

### Dilate

It is just the opposite of erosion. Therefore, it increases the white region in the image or increases the size of the foreground object.

### Opening

The opening is just another name for erosion followed by dilation. It is useful for eliminating noise.

### Closing

Closure is the reverse of opening, dilation followed by erosion. It is useful for closing small holes within foreground objects, or small black dots in the object.
