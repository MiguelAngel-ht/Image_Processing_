# Histogram Matching

In image processing, histogram matching or histogram specification is the transformation of an image so that its histogram matches a specified histogram.
The well-known histogram equalization method is a special case in which the specified histogram is uniformly distributed.

# CLAHE 

Ordinary AHE tends to overamplify the contrast in near-constant regions of the image, since the histogram in such regions is highly concentrated. As a result, AHE may cause noise to be amplified in near-constant regions. 
Contrast Limited AHE (CLAHE) is a variant of adaptive histogram equalization in which the contrast amplification is limited, so as to reduce this problem of noise amplification.
