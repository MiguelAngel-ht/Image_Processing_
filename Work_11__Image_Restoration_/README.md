# Image Restoration

Image restoration is the operation of taking a corrupt/noisy image and estimating the clean, original image. 
Corruption may come in many forms such as motion blur, noise and camera mis-focus.

This file contains adpmedian and spfilt functions in python using numpy and opencv. Those functions are originals from the book Digital Image Processing by Gonzalez...
